You are a focused subagent reviewer for a single holistic investigation batch.

Repository root: /mnt/d/git/word-sketch-lucene

Batch index: 6
Batch name: abstraction_fitness
Batch rationale: abstraction_fitness review

DIMENSION TO EVALUATE:

## abstraction_fitness
Abstractions that pay for themselves with real leverage
Look for:
- Pass-through wrappers or interfaces that add no behavior, policy, or translation
- Cross-cutting wrapper chains where call depth increases without added value
- Interface/protocol families where most declared contracts have only one implementation
- Systemic util/helper dumping grounds that create low cohesion across modules
- Leaky abstractions: callers consistently bypass intended interfaces
- Wide options/context bag APIs that hide true domain boundaries
- Generic/type-parameter machinery used in only one concrete way
- Delegation-heavy classes where most methods forward to an inner object (high delegation ratio)
- Facade/re-export modules that define no logic of their own
- Getter functions whose body is solely return x.get(key) — the underlying type should be an object with properties instead of dict access
Skip:
- Dependency-injection or framework abstractions required for wiring/testability
- Adapters that intentionally isolate external API volatility
- Cases where abstraction clearly reduces duplication across multiple callers
- Thin wrappers that consistently enforce policy (auth/logging/metrics/caching)
- If the core issue is dependency direction or cycles, use cross_module_architecture

YOUR TASK: Read the code for this batch's dimension. Judge how well the codebase serves a developer from that perspective. The dimension rubric above defines what good looks like. Cite specific observations that explain your judgment.

Mechanical scan evidence — navigation aid, not scoring evidence:
The blind packet contains `holistic_context.scan_evidence` with aggregated signals from all mechanical detectors — including complexity hotspots, error hotspots, signal density index, boundary violations, and systemic patterns. Use these as starting points for where to look beyond the seed files.

Previously flagged issues — navigation aid, not scoring evidence:
Check whether open issues still exist. Do not re-report resolved or deferred items.
If several past issues share a root cause, call that out.

  Still open (3):

Phase 1 — Observe:
1. Read the blind packet's `system_prompt` — scoring rules and calibration.
2. Study the dimension rubric (description, look_for, skip).
3. Review the existing characteristics list — which are settled? Which are positive? What needs updating?
4. Explore the codebase freely. Use scan evidence, historical issues, and mechanical findings as navigation aids.
5. Adjudicate mechanical concern signals (confirm/dismiss with fingerprint).
6. Augment the characteristics list via context_updates: positive patterns (positive: true), neutral characteristics, design insights.
7. Collect defects for issues[].
8. Respect scope controls: exclude files/directories marked by `exclude`, `suppress`, or non-production zone overrides.
9. Output a Phase 1 summary: list ALL characteristics for this dimension (existing + new, mark [+] for positive) and all defects collected. This is your consolidated reference for Phase 2.

Phase 2 — Judge (after Phase 1 is complete):
10. Keep issues and scoring scoped to this batch's dimension.
11. Return 0-10 issues for this batch (empty array allowed).
12. For abstraction_fitness, use evidence from `holistic_context.abstractions`:
13. - `delegation_heavy_classes`: classes where most methods forward to an inner object — entries include class_name, delegate_target, sample_methods, and line number.
14. - `facade_modules`: re-export-only modules with high re_export_ratio — entries include samples (re-exported names) and loc.
15. - `typed_dict_violations`: TypedDict fields accessed via .get()/.setdefault()/.pop() — entries include typed_dict_name, violation_type, field, and line number.
16. - `complexity_hotspots`: files where mechanical analysis found extreme parameter counts, deep nesting, or disconnected responsibility clusters.
17. Include `delegation_density`, `definition_directness`, and `type_discipline` alongside existing sub-axes in dimension_notes when evidence supports it.
18. Complete `dimension_judgment`: write dimension_character (synthesizing characteristics and defects) then score_rationale. Set the score LAST.
19. Output context_updates with your Phase 1 observations. Use `add` with a clear header (5-10 words) and description (1-3 sentences focused on WHY, not WHAT). Positive patterns get `positive: true`. New insights can be `settled: true` when confident. Use `settle` to promote existing unsettled insights. Use `remove` for insights no longer true. Omit context_updates if no changes.
20. Do not edit repository files.
21. Return ONLY valid JSON, no markdown fences.
