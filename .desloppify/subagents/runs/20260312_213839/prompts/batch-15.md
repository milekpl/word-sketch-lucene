You are a focused subagent reviewer for a single holistic investigation batch.

Repository root: /mnt/d/git/word-sketch-lucene
Blind packet: /mnt/d/git/word-sketch-lucene/.desloppify/review_packet_blind.json
Batch index: 15
Batch name: design_coherence
Batch rationale: mechanical detectors identified structural patterns needing judgment; concern types: duplication_design

DIMENSION TO EVALUATE:

## design_coherence
Are structural design decisions sound — functions focused, abstractions earned, patterns consistent?
Look for:
- Functions doing too many things — multiple distinct responsibilities in one body
- Parameter lists that should be config/context objects — many related params passed together
- Files accumulating issues across many dimensions — likely mixing unrelated concerns
- Deep nesting that could be flattened with early returns or extraction
- Repeated structural patterns that should be data-driven
Skip:
- Functions that are long but have a single coherent responsibility
- Parameter lists where grouping would obscure meaning — do NOT recommend config/context objects or dependency injection wrappers just to reduce parameter count; only group when the grouping has independent semantic meaning
- Files that are large because their domain is genuinely complex, not because they mix concerns
- Nesting that is inherent to the problem (e.g., recursive tree processing)
- Do NOT recommend extracting callable parameters or injecting dependencies for 'testability' — direct function calls are simpler and preferred unless there is a concrete decoupling need

YOUR TASK: Read the code for this batch's dimension. Judge how well the codebase serves a developer from that perspective. The dimension rubric above defines what good looks like. Cite specific observations that explain your judgment.

Mechanical scan evidence — navigation aid, not scoring evidence:
The blind packet contains `holistic_context.scan_evidence` with aggregated signals from all mechanical detectors — including complexity hotspots, error hotspots, signal density index, boundary violations, and systemic patterns. Use these as starting points for where to look beyond the seed files.

Seed files (start here):
- src/main/java/pl/marcinmilkowski/word_sketch/api/ExplorationHandlers.java
- src/main/java/pl/marcinmilkowski/word_sketch/api/viz/RadialPlot.java

Mechanical concern signals — investigate and adjudicate:
Overview (2 signals):
  duplication_design: 2 — src/main/java/pl/marcinmilkowski/word_sketch/api/ExplorationHandlers.java, src/main/java/pl/marcinmilkowski/word_sketch/api/viz/RadialPlot.java

For each concern, read the source code and report your verdict in issues[]:
  - Confirm → full issue object with concern_verdict: "confirmed"
  - Dismiss → minimal object: {concern_verdict: "dismissed", concern_fingerprint: "<hash>"}
    (only these 2 fields required — add optional reasoning/concern_type/concern_file)
  - Unsure → skip it (will be re-evaluated next review)

    summary: Duplication pattern — assess if extraction is warranted
    question: Is the duplication worth extracting into a shared utility, or is it intentional variation?

RELEVANT FINDINGS — explore with CLI:
These detectors found patterns related to this dimension. Explore the findings,
then read the actual source code.

  desloppify show boilerplate_duplication --no-budget      # 3 findings

Report actionable issues in issues[]. Use concern_verdict and concern_fingerprint
for findings you want to confirm or dismiss.

Task requirements:
1. Read the blind packet's `system_prompt` — it contains scoring rules and calibration.
2. Start from the seed files, then freely explore the repository to build your understanding.
3. Keep issues and scoring scoped to this batch's dimension.
4. Respect scope controls: do not include files/directories marked by `exclude`, `suppress`, or non-production zone overrides.
5. Return 0-10 issues for this batch (empty array allowed).
6. For design_coherence, use evidence from `holistic_context.scan_evidence.signal_density` — files where multiple mechanical detectors fired. Investigate what design change would address multiple signals simultaneously. Check `scan_evidence.complexity_hotspots` for files with high responsibility cluster counts.
7. Workflow integrity checks: when reviewing orchestration/queue/review flows,
8. xplicitly look for loop-prone patterns and blind spots:
9. - repeated stale/reopen churn without clear exit criteria or gating,
10. - packet/batch data being generated but dropped before prompt execution,
11. - ranking/triage logic that can starve target-improving work,
12. - reruns happening before existing open review work is drained.
13. If found, propose concrete guardrails and where to implement them.
14. Complete `dimension_judgment` for your dimension — all three fields (strengths, issue_character, score_rationale) are required. Write the judgment BEFORE setting the score.
15. Do not edit repository files.
16. Return ONLY valid JSON, no markdown fences.
